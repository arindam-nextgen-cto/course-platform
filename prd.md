% NextGen-CTO â€” Product Requirements Document

## 1. Purpose & Vision

### Vision

NextGen-CTO is a cohort-based learning platform where learners gain practical, industry-relevant skills through structured courses, live sessions, peer interaction, and progress tracking. The platform combines video content (YouTube or hosted), written resources, and community features to deliver an immersive learning experience.

### Objectives / Goals

- Enable instructors to launch and manage cohorts
- Deliver video + textual lessons securely and sequentially
- Provide accountability and community via live sessions, discussions, and chat
- Track student progress and provide meaningful analytics
- Support monetization (paid courses, discounts, enrollments)
- Design for scalability, maintainability, and security
- Multi-platform access: web (Next.js fullstack) with mobile/PWA in future
- Modular design to add quizzes, assignments, certificates later
- Be highly configurable: feature flags, admin-driven configuration, and environment-driven behavior

### Target Audience

Aspiring developers, career switchers, tech professionals seeking upskilling, and students who want to build real projects under guidance.

### MVP Scope

Focus on core features: cohort enrollment, video lessons (YouTube embed or private YouTube), lesson progression, live session integration, cohort scheduling, basic discussions, student dashboard, and instructor admin. Expand later to quizzes, assignments, mobile app, and certificates.

- Database: Neon DB (Postgres)
- ORM: Prisma for schema and migrations
- Storage: Supabase Storage / S3 / CDN for assets
- Video delivery & player: Mux for hosted video assets with the @mux/mux-player-react component as the primary player; fallback to YouTube embeds for externally hosted content
- Live sessions: YouTube Live, Zoom, Jitsi, or streaming provider
- Emails: SendGrid, Mailgun, or Supabase SMTP
- Hosting: Vercel (Next.js) or comparable cloud provider
- Observability: Sentry, Google Analytics / Amplitude

### 4.3 Security & Compliance

- Secure authentication and password handling via Supabase
- RBAC for admin/instructor routes
- Input validation and sanitization

- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- GDPR/data privacy considerations

### 4.4 Reliability & Availability

- Target uptime SLA (e.g., 99.9%)
- Regular DB and storage backups
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks
- Monitoring and alerts for latency/errors

### 4.5 Usability & UX

- Responsive, accessible design
- Clear progression indicators and navigation
- Smooth enrollment and payment flows
- Accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers)

### 4.6 Content Management Scalability

- Bulk upload (CSV/JSON) for lessons and cohorts
- Versioning for lesson drafts and published copies
- Preview mode before publishing
- Cloneable course/cohort templates

## 5. MVP Definition & Phases

## 6. Data Model / Schema (High Level)

Core entities and relationships (conceptual):

- User: id, name, email, password_hash, role, bio, avatar, created_at, updated_at
- Course: id, title, slug, description, image, level, category, created_at, updated_at
- Cohort: id, course_id, name, start_date, end_date, capacity, status, price, registration_deadline, created_at, updated_at
- Section / Module: id, course_id, title, order_index
- Lesson: id, (cohort_id | course_id), section_id, title, description, video_url, content (markdown/html), order_index, published, created_at, updated_at
- Enrollment: id, user_id, cohort_id, status (enrolled/cancelled/completed), enrolled_at, completed_at
- LessonProgress: id, user_id, lesson_id, status (not_started/in_progress/complete), completed_at
- LiveSession: id, cohort_id, title, start_time, end_time, link/embed_url, recording_url
- Comment: id, user_id, lesson_id, parent_comment_id, content, created_at, updated_at
- Announcement: id, cohort_id, title, content, created_at
- Transaction: id, user_id, cohort_id, amount, currency, status, payment_gateway_id, created_at
- Coupon: id, code, discount_type, amount, valid_from, valid_to, usage_limit

You may add auxiliary tables for logs, notifications, audits, and analytics.

## 7. API / Flow Sketches

Key user flows (examples):

- User: sign up â†’ browse courses â†’ enroll in cohort â†’ access lessons
- Instructor: login â†’ create course â†’ create cohort â†’ add lessons â†’ schedule live sessions â†’ view student progress
- Live session: schedule â†’ notify â†’ join embed â†’ record/replay
- Progress tracking: view lesson â†’ play video â†’ mark complete â†’ update progress

Design REST or GraphQL APIs to support these flows: e.g. GET /courses, POST /enrollments, GET /lessons/:id, POST /lessonprogress

## 8. UI / UX Considerations

- Use modern UI libraries (Tailwind, Chakra UI, Material UI)
- Clear primary navigation (Courses, Dashboard, Profile)
- Breadcrumbs within lesson pages
- Progress bars, checkmarks, and toasts for feedback
- Live session banners and countdowns
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- Handle empty/error states gracefully

| Cohort drop-off          | Use reminders, community features, and gamification                              |
| Payment errors           | Use reliable gateways, implement retries and logging                             |
| Feature creep            | Stick to MVP scope and phased roadmap                                            |
| Content maintenance      | Versioning, drafts, and content management workflows                             |

Total: ~12â€“16 weeks (3â€“4 months) for a solid MVP depending on team size.

## 12. Technical Considerations & Implementation Tips

- Next.js: choose App Router or Pages Router; SSR/SSG for marketing, CSR for dashboards
- Supabase Auth: can be used directly or alongside NextAuth
- Prisma: schema, migrations, and generated types for DB access
- Neon DB: managed Postgres that works with Prisma
- YouTube embedding: prefer unlisted/private videos; gate access behind enrollment checks
- Emails: SendGrid, Mailgun, or Supabase SMTP
- Deployment: Vercel for Next.js; CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Assets: use CDN or Supabase Storage for images and PDFs
- Caching: edge caching and Redis/in-memory caches for heavy endpoints
- Observability: Sentry for errors, analytics for usage
- Testing: unit, integration, and e2e (Playwright)

## 13. Success Criteria & Launch Plan

### Success Criteria (MVP)

- Onboard first 50 paying/enrolled students
- At least one full cohort completes (monitor completion rate)
- No major downtime or catastrophic bugs
- Positive instructor feedback
- Baseline retention and engagement metrics met

### Launch Plan

- Soft beta with invited users and early adopters
- Collect feedback, iterate, and fix bugs
- Marketing push (YouTube, social, newsletters)
